# ðŸ“š Thevesh's Project Portfolio

Welcome to my **personal project repository**!  
I'm a **data analytics student** with a passion for exploring and building projects beyond my academic scope â€” from data analysis and visualization to creative web development and automation scripts.

This repository serves as a space to document my learning journey, experiments, and real-world applications. Whether it's a class assignment, a freelance project, or something I built just for fun, you'll find it here.

## ðŸ’Ž Project: Jewels Health & Beauty Spa

One of my early projects â€” a custom website built from scratch for my mother's spa business, **Jewels Health & Beauty Spa**.  
The site uses **HTML** and **CSS**, with **JavaScript** for animations and a responsive image carousel.
